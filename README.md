# Social-Network-site
<h1>Social Networking Site</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project was comprehensively about designing a Social Networking site as the name suggests. 
Certain customizations were added to make the project more realistic. This was a simple test-tool to
help in learning how most social networking sites are built with the basic click-ons integrated in the
bulid. A responsive system was also integrated for the website to fit on every screen </p>
<h3>Languages Used</h3>
<ul><li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Meteor</li>

but in a later time they would be added.</p>
